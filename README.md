### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

  While there weren't any topics in Unit 5, we were given instruction on how to create a User Authentication and a review on past topics: Frontend/Backend, Axios, useEffect. These topic reviews and code alongs helped us to complete the Kudos Board project as a pod.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
  With more time, we would try to clean up the current code being used and then implement stretch features: Accounts and Comment section for the cards. These features would give the Kudos Board more user interaction. Finally, we'd work on the CSS and give the app a polished feel

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

  During our project demo, our project was able to create and display the boards. And when selected, it would show and create the cards; all being saved to the database. While the search feature didn't work as intended, we were successfull
